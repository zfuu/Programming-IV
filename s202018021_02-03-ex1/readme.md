## 1. Instruction to compile the code

After using the `cd` (change directory) command to navigate to the correct working directory, use these following commands to compile the code:

```bash
% gcc 02-03-ex1.c
% ./a.out 
```

## 2. Brief review of the code
This is a very simple piece of logic, where the program simply prints out `argc` and `argv`.

## 3. Result of execution 
```
% gcc 02-03-ex1.c

% ./a.out 
There are 1 arguments.
./a.out

% ./a.out aaa bbb ccc

./a.out
aaa
bbb
ccc
```
